# Algorithm Performance Analyzer

Algorithm Performance Analyzer is a C++ tool that compares brute-force
and optimized algorithmic solutions by measuring their actual execution time.

Using the same input, the program runs multiple approaches and reports
their runtime, demonstrating the practical impact of time complexity
and algorithm selection.

This project bridges theoretical time complexity analysis with real-world
performance measurement.
